Developed a NextJS based responsive website mainly to showcase myself with all the projects ive worked with.

Used GraphCMS to store and query data using GraphQL

Used NextJs to write down my API endpoints and write my front end using Tailwind CSS

Deployed the website using VERCEL which performs continous build and shipping.
